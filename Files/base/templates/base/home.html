					<h4>About</h4>
					<hr>
                    <p>A young and enthusiastic undergrad having undivided passion towards accomplishing all of his goals.</p>
					<p>From the very beginning of my journey in the field of Science I have been attracted towards Robotics and programming. I did various projects and also went abroad (NASA) to further extend my knowledge in this field. When I was on my Science trip to NASA I took part in many programs like Space Challenge Program, IT Wizard Programming & Productivity Program etc, which made my goals crystal clear. From that day on I made up my mind that I had to pursue my career in Data Science.</p>
					<p>Since then, I have been paving my path step by step towards my goals.</p>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science & Information Technology, apart from that I spend my time learning all the concept necessary to become a successful Data Scientists through various blogs and courses available online.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>I'm still learning and and doing small-mid level projects</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
